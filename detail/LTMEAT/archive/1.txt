BABY METHOD
FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGED

---

1. Follow step one of the original instructions to find a page belonging to the Chrome extension you want to disable.

2. Visit that chrome-extension:// page, then type chrome://hang in the URL bar of that tab. It should start loading infinitely.

3. Right-click the tab and duplicate it. Don't close anything.

4. Go to the chrome://extensions page for the extension you want to disable. See https://ltmeat.bypassi.com/img/vid.webm

5. If that page has any sort of switch, such as "Allow access to file URLs", click that switch. If there are no clickable switches, cry in a corner or something.

The extension should now be broken, assuming you clicked the switch! Only one of the two duplicate tabs should be left standing. You can close your tabs now. Refer to the help section for more help.
